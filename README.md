   I have in mind three numbers with the following characteristics.  

   Each is a multiple of 3 and consists of three different non-zero
   digits, just one of which is 3.

   Each of the three numbers individually satisfies three of the
   following conditions, and fails three.

   1. the number is the product of three distinct primes
   2. the number is triangular (is in the series 1,3,6,10,15,...)
   3. the number is a cube, or a cube + 3
   4. the number may be written as a single digit prime followed by a 2-digit prime
   5. the 3 is the first or last digit
   6. the number may be written as a two-digit prime, followed by a single digit 
      prime.

   What are my three numbers?
